## Generative AI - Prompt Engineering

### Welcome.

This repo contains resources to explore the world of generative ai through prompt engineering.

### Notebooks: 
- [Prompt Engineering - Chatbot](notebooks/prompt-engineering-chatbot.ipynb)
    - In this notebook we will look at a few prompt engineering techniques.  We will experiment by loading a - relatively small - 3 billion parameter Large Language Model (LLM) within the notebook environment itself and throwing some prompts its way to see what we can make it do.
    - This notebook has been designed, written and tested to run for free on [Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/) with GPU.  Studio Lab is a free machine learning (ML) development environment that provides compute and storage (up to 15GB) at no cost with NO credit card required.
